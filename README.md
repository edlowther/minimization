# Minimization

Open-source software to randomly allocate participants in clinical trials to the control or experimental arms of a study, while minimizing differences in the distribution of key patient characteristics between the two study groups. 

### Motivation

While a "biased coin" that implements the minimization algorithm is relatively straightforward to generate, it is more challenging to keep a record of how this process has assigned trial participants to their respective groups over the course of a study, while enabling multiple members of a clinical trial team to access this record and enter new trial participants' data, whenever they need to do so.

It is also vital that data of this nature is not able to be seen by the wrong people, and that nobody can edit the record without the approval of the study team.

Using a tool like `git` in combination with the web-based git platforms that make accessing and sharing files straightforward, provide the backend infrastructure to run the code which flips the biased coin, and also handle user authentication for your team, is ideally suited to this task.

This repository will guide you through the configuration required to get you started on your own project. 

### Usage

This software was originally deployed inside UCL's Trusted Research Environment (the [Data Safe Haven](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/file-storage-sharing/data-safe-haven-dsh)) on a secure instance of GitLab. To review the code as it was used there, please see [the `production` branch of this repository](https://github.com/edlowther/minimization/tree/production).

To use this software for your own clinical trial, please follow these steps to customise the code:

- First create an account on [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - if you are new to the platform you may wish to start with the free trial option
- Enter your details, then click on "Import" your first project
- Your project will need to be assigned to a "group name", enter something appropriate
- Then click on "Repository by URL" and enter: https://github.com/edlowther/minimization.git
- Leave "Mirror repository" unchecked, and give the project a name and a "slug" e.g. `minimization` for both
- Set the visibility level - "Private" may be a good choice if real patient data is involved (even if it is anonymized), then click "Create project"
- Once your project has been created, click on "Settings" in the left-hand navigation bar, then "Access Tokens"
- Click on "Add new" then give it a name (e.g. `minimization`) and an expiry date that can be up to one year into the future
- For "Select a role", choose "Developer", then check the `write_repository` box
- Click "Create project access token", and click on the clipboard icon that appears to copy this into your clipboard
- Click on "Settings" again in the left-hand navigation bar, then "CI/CD"
- "Expand" the Variables section, and click "Add variable"
- Set Visibility to "Masked"
- Uncheck "Protect variable"
- In the "Key" text entry field type "ACCESS_TOKEN" (without the quotation marks)
- Paste the token that should still be in your clipboard into the "Value" text entry field, then click "Add variable"
- Click on "Settings" then "Repository" in left-hand navigation bar, then "Expand" the "Branch defaults" section
- Select `gitlab` to be the new default branch, then click "Save changes"
- From the project homepage, click on `.gitlab-ci.yml` - then click on the blue "Edit" button, then "Edit single file"
- Enter your GitLab username and email address in the relevant git config lines, you can use the `noreply` GitLab email address if you like, which follows this pattern: `<YOUR_GITLAB_USER_ID>-<YOUR_GITLAB_USERNAME>@users.noreply.gitlab.com` (you can find the user id in your [user settings](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/profile))
- Change the git remote url so that it follows the pattern: `https://<YOUR_GITLAB_USERNAME>:$ACCESS_TOKEN@gitlab.com/<YOUR_GITLAB_ORG_NAME>/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
- Double check your configuration changes then click "Commit changes"
- Click on pipelines, then "Verify my account", then enter the data requested to enable this project to function on GitLab

The project configuration should now be complete, and you can start adding trial-specific data. Follow the instructions in the README displayed at the [root of the `gitlab` branch](https://github.com/edlowther/minimization/tree/gitlab).

A separate branch containing an alternative version of the software that can be deployed on GitHub will be published here in due course.
